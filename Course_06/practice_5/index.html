                        to be! There
                        are many ways to simplify your life, <a href="#">a few of which we've explored in the past.</a>
                        This week we're
                        taking a bit of a approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you already
                        living.</p>

                        <p class="article-content">Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be
                            healthy, you have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking
                            nice and simple.</p>

                        <p class="article-content">Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it
                            ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as
                            simple as possible, it will help balance everything out. </p>

                        <p class="article-content">A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either
                            don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for.
                            Staying simple will help draw the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never
                            before.</p>
