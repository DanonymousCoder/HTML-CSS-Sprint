                    </h2>

                    <p class="article-content"><span>I used to be a pack rat.</span>I had so many things that I thought
                        that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                    </p>

                    <p class="article-content">
                        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I
                        couldn't hold a relationship.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How I turned things around</h3>

                    <p class="article-content"><span>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                            everything.</span>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and
                        moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                    </p>

                    <p class="article-content">
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else
                        to do. And it worked.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>

                    <p class="article-content">Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less
                        stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                    </p>

                    <p class="article-content">
                        With how much it turned my life around, <span>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing
                            how I
                            did it,</span> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I
